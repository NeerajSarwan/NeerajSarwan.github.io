title: First step towards AI - Hard Coding!
subtitle: Hard Coding an Automated Shower
---
The term Artificial Intelligence has been around for more than half a century - it started out with a simple idea of automating the tasks requiring human intervention. It is the innate nature of laziness(& innovation ðŸ˜…) in humans that gave rise to the Idea of Artificial Intelligence to extend ourselves with intelligent "modules" which makes our lives easier/better.

I started out on the journey of AI following the same idea - automating a simple task - to skip one step in my daily life. During my second year vacations from college, I was into robotics and I was building standard examples: [line follower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDxIorDI1VQ), [self balancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_afq1DTAJZo) and [object follower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsEr7UbAK5A) wheel based designs. It wasn't very satisfying because I was not building any "solution". Once I was taking a bath(best place to get new ideas) and it struck me - Why not automate the shower? It was then, all the questions popped up with all the answers:
1. How to detect human presence? - Ultrasond sensor
2. How to open the shower knobs? - DC Motors
3. Control them? Duh.. you already have an Arduino 
4. Can I control the temperature? - Yes!
5. How? - **Hard Code it!**
6. Lastly, what should I name it? -

## Know-it-all Shower
Fitted with ultrasound sensors to detect human presence, dc motors are fitted on the shower knobs using metal contraptions to run when triggered. The te
